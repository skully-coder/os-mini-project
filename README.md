- Implementation of links 
- A manual page, indicate the usage of included functions 

## Co-related topics: 

We would be taking inference from the following topics: 
- File system management 
- Inter Process Communication 
- Working with regular files and directory structures  

## Learning Outcomes: 

By implementing the given project, we will be able to grasp knowledge about various operating system basic concepts like, exploring various file functions and how to implement them, getting a deeper understanding of various intercrosses communication techniques used majorly and last but not the least, working with regular files and directory structures. 

This will overall help us to get a deeper and proper understanding of the operating system. 

## Execution:
Change to the current directory and run the shell script `./run.sh`. This will compile the project and excecute it.
